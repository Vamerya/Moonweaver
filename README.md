# Moonweaver

## 🌙 General information

**Moonweaver** was created for our final submission of the 3rd semester in our game design school.  
The game was created over the course of two months with 4 members, with me (Vamerya) being the programmer and sounddesigner.


## ⌨️ How to set up the project
    
- create a new Unity 2D project with the **URP** preset, using Editor Version 2022.2.1f1.
- install the **New Input System** from the built in Unity package manager
- install **Cinemachine** from the built in Unity package manager


## 🎶 Sound

Wwise was used for the implementation of the sound and the logic behind it, the project is also available in this repo.  
Music is available [here](https://soundcloud.com/xvamerya/sets/moonweaver-soundtracks/)!


## ❗ Known problems

- The code became really messy in some places near the end of the deadline (mostly in the player controller, everything else looks fine!)
- Sometimes the attack animations freeze (a mechanism was implemented to get rid of the frozen animation after a few seconds)
